# Contributing

Contributions are welcome.

## Code quality control

> All files inside this project are automatically built, linted and tested by [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/atSCM/atscm).

Builds will only pass if they meet the following criteria:

- **No ESLint errors:** We use [ESLint](http://eslint.org) to lint our entire JavaScript code. The config used is [eslint-config-lsage](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-lsage). Any lint errors will cause the build to fail.
- **Test coverage >= 90%:** We use [istanbul](https://gotwarlost.github.io/istanbul/) to validate test coverage is at least 90 percent. Any commits not covered by tests will cause the build to fail.
- **Documentation coverage >= 90%:** Our source code is documented using [ESDoc](https://esdoc.org). We will only merge if your contribution is documented as well.

## Setting up the development environment

> In order to meet out coding guideline it's very useful to have your development environment set up right.

### Linting files

You can lint all source files by running `npm run lint`. Although most IDEs support running it directly in the editor:

**Jetbeans Webstorm**

[Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) has built-in support for ESLint. Check out [their documentation](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/2016.3/eslint.html) to set it up.

**Atom**

[Atom](https://atom.io) has several packages that provide support for inline ESLint validation. We recommend you to use [linter-eslint](https://atom.io/packages/linter-eslint).

### Running tests

Our [mocha](https://mochajs.org) tests can be run by calling `npm test`. If you want the tests to be run right after you saved your changes, then run `npm run test:watch`.

Test coverage can be checked by running `npm run test:coverage`.

### Creating API documentation

Run `npm run docs` to create [ESDoc](https://esdoc.org) API documentation.
